                <p ><img src="./images/6.jpg" class="left"      >Japan is an island country located in East Asia, consisting of four main islands and thousands of smaller islands. Almost four-fifths of the country is covered by mountains, with Mount Fuji being the highest peak.
Japan once experienced a long period of isolation until it began to rapidly modernize in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, Japan's capital "Tokyo" is one of the largest and most active cities in the world, and Japan's technology, culture, food, animation, etc. are loved by the world.</p>
                <p ><img src="./images/7.jpg" class="left"      >Japan has a long history and unique culture. The ancient tea ceremony, flower arrangement, and Bushido spirit show its admiration for etiquette, aesthetics, and loyalty. Its animation industry is even more unique. Works such as "Spirited Away" and "Naruto" are popular all over the world, not only bringing rich economic benefits to Japan, but also spreading Japanese culture and values. Japanese food is also mouth-watering. Sushi, sashimi, ramen, Japanese cuisine, etc. are famous for their fresh ingredients, exquisite plating, and unique taste.</p>
