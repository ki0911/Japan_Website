Its production seems simple, but it actually contains deep craftsmanship. Fresh sashimi, such as tuna, salmon, sea bream, etc.,
				are cut into thin slices and spread on soft and glutinous vinegar rice. The acidity and temperature of the vinegar rice must be precisely controlled to complement the sashimi.</p>

The key to a bowl of authentic ramen is the rich and mellow soup. The soup of tonkotsu ramen is made from pork bones for a long time, and every mouthful is full of the rich aroma of pork bones. The chewy noodles fully absorb the essence of the soup in the soup, and are paired with barbecued pork, bamboo shoots, seaweed, chopped green onions and other side dishes. A bowl of					steaming ramen can always dispel the cold, comfort the body and mind, and let people immerse themselves in this rich and delicious taste.</p>
